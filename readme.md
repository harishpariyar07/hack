## Solving problems faced by college students

# Project Description:

<p/>The project is particularly aimed to create an all-in-one solution for the problems a student faces in his/her college. This project has been initiated as a prototype for the hackathon – HackTU. As the prototype had to be created under a time constraint, we have used different sources(Mentioned in later part of the doc.) to build it but the all the project ideation is our own. 
The main problems we tried to address via it are :

## 1. Lack of study material:

    To ensure that the material gets updated timely we are keeping a point-based system i.e. the material provider will earn points according to the materials uploaded and these points can be later redeemed for different rewards.

## 2. Hostel room allocation:

     The major issues which students face when they come to college is hostel room allocation. We have integrated a platform where students interesting in swapping their rooms/hostels can find the person with similar needs in a hassle-free way.

## 3. Lost and found stuff:

    Losing your stuff is a very common problem and all those mails related to it becomes very annoying sometimes. We have integrated a platform to solve this issue too.

## 4. Food delivery:

    It is very tedious to keep list of all the food shops and cafes along with their contacts.
    We are trying to cover all those shops under a specific section of our project along with their menu and contacts.

## 5. Events:

    News about all the college societies’ events/activities and any other update from the college itself will be provided to user via notifications and will be present under the news section of our project too.

## 6. Miscellaneous:

    We are also trying to cover certain issues like contacting the teachers directly, seeking help from your peer/seniors and selling or renting out your stuff inside our project too.
